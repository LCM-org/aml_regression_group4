This project is related to the AML Advanced Python AI and ML Tools
The selected dataset is related to the Automobile price and attributes related to it like model, manufacturing year etc.
The data set is loaded and operated using the pandas dataframe and cleansing the data is done where the values of the columns are null or not avialable
Further the outliers are removed from the dataset using the IQR and scaling is done on the data. 
The text values are converted to numericals before performing the regressions.
The dataset is split into test and training and Linear regression model is applied on the train dataset. The trained model is then tested using the test data.
